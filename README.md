## Synopsis

This is my online profile using BackboneJS ReactJS and RequireJS


## Motivation

I created this profile because I love Front End Development so much and I wanna challenge myself on the new techniques for Front End on the web. I would use Meteor for the project but I already have been in 2 Meteor Projects so I wanna try in BackboneJS and ReactJS.

## Installation

Get in the tools folder, install node components and bower components : 
`sudo npm install`
`sudo bower install`

and run : 
- for running gulp tasks : 
`gulp`

- for running on development :
`gulp watch`

- for running on production :
`gulp production`

## Tests

Will implement testing code soon.
